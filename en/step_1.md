## Introduction

Make a reusable party popper that rewards you with a light and sound display when it is pulled.

In the [LED Firefly project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/led-firefly){:target="_blank"}, you used a single colour LED. For your party popper, you will be using a different kind of LED, called an RGB LED that can display multiple colours.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 10px;">
<div style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px; display:flex; margin-bottom: 27px;"><p><span style="color: #0faeb0">Party poppers</span> are famously used to celebrate special occasions all around the world. They usually have a piece of string that can be pulled to make a loud sound and release some confetti into the air. If you haven't seen one before, you might recognise the party popper emoji!</p>

You will:

+ Code an **RGB LED** to light in different colours and fade out. 
+ Create a sound effect.
+ Make a contact switch out of card, foil and string.

### You will need:

**Hardware:**
+ A Raspberry Pi Pico with pin headers soldered on  
+ A **data** USB A to micro USB cable
+ A **passive** buzzer
+ 1 x RGB LEDs 
+ 6 socket-socket jumper wires
+ 2 socket-pin jumper wires 
+ Craft items such as corrugated card, kitchen foil, string, ribbon, coloured paper, and sticky tape or duct tape

**Software:**
+ Thonny - this project can be completed using the Thonny Python editor which can be installed on a Linux, Windows or Mac computer.
