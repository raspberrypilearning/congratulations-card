## What next?

If you are following the [Introduction to the Raspberry Pi Pico](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/pico-intro) path, you can move on to the [Beating Heart](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/beating-heart) project. In this project, you will make an LED fade and brighten to create a pulse effect and you will control the heart rate by using a potentiometer to make a dial.
