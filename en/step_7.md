## Upgrade your project

If you have time, there are lots of upgrades you could make to your party popper. 

Can you think of an event where you could use your party popper to celebrate? 

You could keep a party popper ready to celebrate whenever you fix a bug, complete a project, or learn a new skill.

You could:

+ Program a longer sequence of light changes and sounds. You will get good results from note frequencies between 250 and 500.
+ Make a paper cone for your RGB LED and buzzer.
+ Decorate your paper popper switch or make it more robust. 
+ Customize your party popper with colours and sounds for a specific event. Can you use the colours of your favourite sports team or the flag for your country? You could program a tune related to the event.
